            Hilma Af Klint, born in 1862 Stockholm, used geometric patterns and
            symmetry greatly in her abstract work. Her early work consisted of
            landscapes, self portraits and botanist studies until she become
            captivated by the spiritual world. She began to conduct seances with
            a group of women who named themselves, The Five. They would
            encounter spirits and guides during these seances who would send
            them messages. Klint expressed that she received a secret commission
            from one of the guides. 196 paintings were produced which
            represented the Spirit of the World. The Guggenheim describes her
            work baring a 'mystical, idiosyncratic geometry' to depict this
            living being of the world. In her work there are many
            representations and themes than run through the paintings, like a
            code. For one example, the colours. Blue represents female, yellow
            is male and the colour green is the unity of both these genders.
            After discovering the works of Hilma Af Klint and her use of
            geometry, symbolism, I attempted to try and create pieces using
            these ideas. For example, the piece on the left, I directly tried to
            imitate what I see the universe as in the form of shapes and took
            inspiration from Klint's colour theory. I feel however, my attempt
            was not successful as it was superficial. I have no connection to
            spirits and my representation is superficial and based on aesthetics
            and my ignorant ways of thinking. On the other hand, I tried to draw
            on what I did know and do some research into Chinese medicine. My
            family have been going to accupuncturists my whole life and I have
            always been surrounded by these drawings representing the practise.
            Such as the five elements, earth, water, fire, wood and metal, and
            their control over different parts of our body. On the first piece,
            I added these elements connecting to a tree's roots. Klint made many
            'Tree of Knowledge' paintings, however, I decided to use the tree
            symbol to not only represent knowledge but the body also. I did not
            include the canopy of the tree though, and instead cut it off with
            dark colours to represent the unknown. This is because I felt that
            if the tree was to represent the body and the knowledge instilled in
            this body, then there is some restricted to the knowledge and there
            is so much each body from each species will not know. I feel this
            was a response to how I felt trying to make work like Klint's which
            has so much underlying spiritual meaning. Acrylic was also not
            working for me with how fast the paint dried. I felt like this meant
            I had to work more quickly and plan before; this wasn't effective to
            allow for thinking and adjustments when I was painting. I moved onto
            oils after these two pieces and tried again to work freely and
            conceptually.{" "}
